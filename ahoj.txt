zThis function changes the logical read/write position in the specified
    file, by incrementing or decrementing the value assigned to the file
    pointer. The offset to add to the file pointer is given as a signed
    32-bit integer in the CX:DX register pair--the more significant
    portion of the offset in CX. A mode code, specified in AL, indicates
    whether the offset specified in CX:DX is referenced to the beginning
    of the file (mode 0), the pointer's current location (mode 1), or the
    end of the file (mode 2).
